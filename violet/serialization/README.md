# ðŸŒºðŸ’œ `Noelware.Violet.Serialization`
The **Noelware.Violet.Serialization** C++26 library allows you to serialize and deserialize C++ objects into interchangeable formats that can be self-described. The library is inspired by Rust's [`serde`] and Kotlin's [`kotlinx.serialization`].

[`serde`]: https://serde.rs
[`kotlinx.serialization`]: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization

The purpose of this library is to ensure that C++ objects can be self-described and serialized for applications that might require sending or retrieving objects from unknown data formats that can be transformed into C++ objects to allow type-safety.
