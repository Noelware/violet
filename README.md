### ðŸŒºðŸ’œ Violet
### *Extended standard library for C++26*

**Violet** is a C++26 library that extends C++'s standard library with better enriching types and provide a common framework for building C++ applications from the ground up without much effort. **Violet** was made to help develop our projects to bridge common code between our products and services using C++ a lot easier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Violet** uses a rather unique versioning scheme: `year.month.revision` (i.e, `2025.09.01`).
>
> We decided on this because it is very easy to see when a version of the library was released and doesn't
> enforce "breaking/change" semantics like [SemVer](https://semver.org), we depend on release timing for
> the scope of the library.
